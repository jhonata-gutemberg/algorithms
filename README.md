## üß† What Is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions or rules designed to solve a problem or perform a task. Think of it like a recipe: just as a recipe tells you how to make a dish, an algorithm tells a computer (or person) how to achieve a specific goal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Characteristics
- Finite Steps: Every algorithm has a clear beginning and end.
- Well-Defined Instructions: Each step must be precise and unambiguous.
- Input & Output: Algorithms take input, process it, and produce output.
- Effectiveness: The steps should be doable and lead to a solution.

## üß© Types of Algorithms
| Type                | Description                                                | Example                       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Search Algorithms   | Find specific data in a structure                          | Binary Search                 |
| Sort Algorithms     | Arrange data in a particular order                         | Quick Sort, Merge Sort        |
| Recursive           | Solve problems by breaking them into subproblems           | Factorial, Fibonacci sequence |
| Greedy              | Make the best choice at each step                          | Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path      |
| Dynamic Programming | Solve complex problems by storing solutions to subproblems | Knapsack problem              |

## üíª Real-Life Applications
- Navigation apps use pathfinding algorithms to find the fastest route.
- Search engines use algorithms to rank and retrieve relevant results.
- Social media platforms use algorithms to recommend content.
- Cryptography relies on algorithms to secure data.
